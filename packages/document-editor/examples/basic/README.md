# Document Editor Example

This example is a minimal React application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It demonstrates how to mount the `EditorContainer` component using a very small in-memory API adapter.

## Running the demo

```
cd examples/basic
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see the editor in action.
