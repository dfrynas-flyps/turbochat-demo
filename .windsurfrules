# Workspace Rules

## Node Version
- Use Node.js version 22.0.0 or higher for all development work
- The runtime environment must support ES2022 features

## Package Management
- Use pnpm as the exclusive package manager
- Run 'pnpm install' to set up all workspaces and dependencies
- Do not mix package managers within the project

## Monorepo Structure
- The project follows a monorepo architecture with Turborepo
- Respect workspace boundaries and dependencies
- Internal packages use workspace references (workspace:*)

## Applications
- Server application:
  - Located in apps/server
  - Uses a modern HTTP framework
  - Build using 'pnpm turbo run build --filter=server'
  - Output goes to apps/server/dist

- Web application:
  - Located in apps/turbochat
  - Uses a React-based framework
  - Build using 'pnpm turbo run build --filter=turbochat'
  - Output goes to apps/turbochat/.next

## Shared Packages
- Common code is stored in the packages directory
- Each package has its own build process
- Imports from shared packages use the namespace format

## Development Workflow
- Run 'pnpm turbo run build' to build all applications and packages
- Each application can be developed independently with its own 'dev' script
- Follow TypeScript conventions throughout the codebase
- Ensure ESLint and other code quality tools pass before committing

## Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Run tests individually per package or application
- Ensure proper isolation between test environments

## Deployment
- Build artifacts are generated separately for each application
- Server runs on modern JavaScript runtime
- Web application is a static site with client-side hydration
